# Obfuscating scripts (100% untraceable)
1. Upload the script to this branch (don't forget to remove debug)
2. Run the Anti dumper and get the encoded link
3. Obfuscate the loadstring including a decoder (lua obfuscator)
4. Make another loadstring referencing the obfuscated script and upload it on the other profile
